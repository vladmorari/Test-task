# Test_task
 In this task I made a page template following the steps below:

1 I created a 'div' tag with the id 'content'
  in which I entered all the other components

2 Inside the 'content' I added four other divs with class 'card'

3 Each 'card' has two other elements :
  
3.1 A "img" tag with 'user_img' class  (contains the user's image )
 
 3.2 A "div" tag with 'user_data' class 

4 In 'user_data' I added three tags:

  4.1 An "h3" tag with 'user_name' class (contains username)

  4.2 An "p" tag with 'user-info' class (contains user information)

  4.3 An "button" tag with 'button' class ( has as content the text 'Do it')

5.All elements have been stylized using simple css 

  Find the styles in the style.css file
